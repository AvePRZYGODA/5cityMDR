  "description": "When career-driven editor Diana Vallejo accidentally summons a familiar whose specialty is soft domination, her life takes a turn for the better â€“ but for how long?\n\nFamiliar is a modern-day, slice-of-life romcomic about magick, work/life balance, BDSM, and relationships. It is kinky, queer, sex-positive, and free to read online. It is also erotic, sexually explicit, and written for adult audiences only.\n\n_______________________________\nhttps://familiar.soushiyo.com",
